🎾 Playing:      +10 XP

### **XP Requirements**

- **Level 1 → 2**: 100 XP
- **Each Level**: Requirements increase by 50%
  - Level 2 → 3: 150 XP
  - Level 3 → 4: 225 XP
  - Level 4 → 5: 337 XP
  - And so on...

### **How to See Progress**

1. Look at "Experience" stat in the right panel
2. Shows format: **"45 / 100"** (current / needed)
3. Bar fills up as you gain XP

- 🏆 **Possible achievement unlock**

### **Fast Leveling Strategy**

**OPTIMAL ROUTINE:**
1. Feed pet (if needed)

3. Feed again (training uses hunger)
4. Play (×2) - Good XP + happiness
5. Let pet sleep (restore energy)
6. Repeat!

**EXAMPLE**: From Level 1 to Level 2
- Training ×5 = 100 XP = **LEVEL UP!**
- Or: Training ×3 (60) + Playing ×4 (40) = 100 XP

**TIME ESTIMATE**:
- Level 1 → 2: ~5 minutes of active play
- Level 1 → 5: ~30-40 minutes
- Level 1 → 10: ~2-3 hours
